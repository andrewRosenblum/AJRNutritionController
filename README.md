------------------
To use `AJRNutritionController` first copy the following files into your project:
- `AJRNutritionViewController.h`
- `AJRNutritionViewController.m`
- `AJRNutritionViewController.xib`
- `AJRNutritionLabelCalculation.h`
- `AJRNutritionLabelCalculation.m`
- `AJRNutritionLabelView.h`
- `AJRNutritionLabelView.m`
- `AJRBackgroundDimmer.h`
- `AJRBackgroundDimmer.m`
- `CloseButton.png`
- `CloseButton@2x.png`

Then in the appropiate method, add the following to initalize the view:

    AJRNutritionViewController *controller = [[AJRNutritionViewController alloc] init];

Set the nutrition values as follows:

    controller.servingSize = @"12 fl oz. (1 Can)";
    controller.calories = 130;
    controller.fat = 5.5;
    controller.carbs = 35;
    controller.sugar = 12;
    controller.protein = 3.0;
    
Finally present the view:

    [controller presentInParentViewController:self];
